Gardeners are a newcomer among the specialist settlers, which was added in order to be able to heal areas destroyed by the Dark Tribe.

Dark Gardeners are their evil counterpart, which destroy health terrain if left unattended. Dark gardeners are usually accompanied and protect by warriors of the Dark Tribe, which is why they should not be challenged without backup. The dark gardeners themselves are defenseless, however, albeit much more durable than their human counterparts.
