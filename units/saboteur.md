### Overview

Saboteurs are specialists who can attack civilian buildings.

Saboteurs have the same disguise ability as thieves do, but do not share their enhanced vision.

### Strategy

Saboteurs are usually restricted in multiplayer matches - if they are permitted, it's usually long after the peacetime has elapsed. Before that, their use is also diminished by the fact that each pickaxe could potentially have been a weapon for another soldier instead. While attacking, saboteurs take the same positions as builders do. This also means that if a building only supports two builders, it can also only be attacked by two saboteurs. This distinguishes them from axemen, which are not affected by such restrictions.

### Trivia

* Saboteurs are not affected by fighting strength
* Saobteurs are often used to proactively bring pickaxes to stonecutter huts prior to their completion.
* Saboteurs cannot be recruited on campaign maps. They can be used normally, however, if the player starts with them or otherwise gets them.
* Dark Tribe buildings as well as harbours and shipyards are immune to saboteurs.
* Despite saboteurs having a damage value of 6, they only do minimal damage to buildings, as all buildings in the game have an armor value of 5.
  * Despite this, saboteurs appear to do more damage than their stats should allow at times, for currently unknown reasons.
