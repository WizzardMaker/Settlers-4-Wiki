### Overview

Blowgunwarriors are the mayan special unit. They are ranged unit similar to archers, but with significantly lower range and damage potential. In exchange, they have some additional have and the ability to immobilize enemy soldiers for brief periods of time.

### Strategy

Theoretically, blowgunwarriors can supplement both swordsmen and archers. In practice, however, their increased health compared to archers is not enough to mitigate the lower range - archers can have several rows fight, while blowgunwarriors can only fight with one row much later.

Against swordsmen and axewarriors, their firepower is simply insufficient to contend with the high health pools of these units.

UBO significantly increases the damage of blowgunwarriors to 150% of an equivalent archer. Due to their lower range, archers and backpack catapultists are still hard counters, but blowgunwarriors can now be a useful counter against melee units.

### Trivia

* Despite not being melee units, blowgunwarriors can benefit from the viking bloodrush spell.
