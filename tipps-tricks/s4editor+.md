## The Editor

The Editor+ is a new version of the Settlers IV map editor, created by MuffinMario. The Editor+ lifts several restrictions of the vanilla editor, allowing mappers to open finished maps (.map), export maps with errors (which official maps also have - one such error would be having more than one Dark Tribe present) and place objects from the New World expansion.

The Editor+ is integrated into [Settlers United](../multiplayer/settlers-united.md).

## Scripts

Additionally, the Editor+ contains a script editor which allows embedding a lua script into your map, removing the need to attach a .txt file to the map download. [Further information on S4 scripting can be found here.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/auUjVOZHHg4G6b8lVuXs/tutorials/readme)
